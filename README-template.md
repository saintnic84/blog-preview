## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to better orient my div elements through the use of the margin element. Also I improved on using figma designs to better help with the development of my project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I want to focus on how I can better replicate the images I see into my own code. I've only just started, but I'm so frustrated that my project doesn't perfectly match the challenge.



### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website is one of the resources online for front end developers. If there's a concept, code, or element you don't understand, you can probably find it at this site. This is where I got better equiped at understanding margin and padding.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a great website for both front end and back end programming languages, I regulary visit here to refresh concepts that I may have forgotten
